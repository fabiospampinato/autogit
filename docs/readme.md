- Pull/push to/from origin, across all your repositories, with one command.
- Edit multiple readmes and have autogit make the commits and pushing them, maybe even bumping the projects' versions and publishing them.
- Synchronize all your repositories' descriptions and keywords with GitHub.
- ...basically anything you want, across all, or some, of your repositories.
